# Understanding Claude's Token Limits and Context Window

You're right to be confused about how these different token limits interact. Let me clarify how all these numbers work together:

## The Core Limits

1. **Context Window (200K tokens)** - This is the absolute maximum size for everything combined:
   - Your input (manuscript + prompt)
   - All of Claude's output (thinking + visible response)

2. **Max Output Tokens (128K in beta)** - This is how much Claude can generate in total:
   - Includes both thinking tokens and visible response
   - Is capped by the `anthropic-beta: output-128k-2025-02-19` header
   - Cannot exceed what's left in the context window after your input

3. **Thinking Budget (32K tokens)** - This is the space for Claude's internal reasoning:
   - Used for deep analysis but not shown to you
   - Is a portion of the output tokens

## How These Limits Interact

For your manuscript analysis with 106,448 input tokens:

```
CONTEXT WINDOW (200K)
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                           |                                         │
│ INPUT (106,448)           │         OUTPUT (93,552 available)       │
│ Manuscript + Prompt       │                                         │
│                           │ THINKING (32K) │ VISIBLE (61,552 max)   │
│                           │                │                        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The important formula is:
- Input tokens + Output tokens ≤ 200K (Context window)
- Thinking tokens + Visible tokens ≤ Output tokens

So even though the beta allows for 128K output tokens, you can only use what's left in the context window after your input. With a 106K token input, you have about 94K tokens available for output (which includes both thinking and visible response).

## What This Means for Your Analysis Tasks

- With a 106K manuscript, you can get the full 32K thinking budget
- You have 62K tokens left for visible output (though you only used 4,183)
- As your manuscript size increases, you'll eventually have to reduce thinking

--- 

> The **tipping point** comes when:
> **Input tokens > (200K - 32K - minimum visible tokens)**

For example, if you need at least 3K tokens for visible output, you'd 
# start losing thinking capacity when your input exceeds 165K tokens.
